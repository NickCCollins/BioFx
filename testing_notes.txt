A few notes for running integration tests:

Steps
1) Run the container for this project in detached mode:
    `docker run -d -p 4000:80 challenge`
2) Run the standalone-firefox container that Selenium has published in detached mode (specify port 4444):
    `docker run -d -p 4444:4444 selenium/standalone-firefox-debug`
3) Run `python tests.py`. Wait and see the results.

If that doesn't work (Connection Errors):
- check that docker is running on `localhost`. If it isn't, put the docker IP into the
    DOCKER_HOST setting (line 13, tests.py), and rerun `python tests.py`.
    - I was running Win OS with the Docker Toolbox Linux VM, the IP was '192.168.99.100' by default.
