A few notes for building and running the docker image:

1) cd to directory that contains the Dockerfile (this dir)
2) Run `docker build -t challenge .` while in a terminal where docker is installed (for me, Docker Toolbox's quickstart
    terminal worked as a light linux VM on Windows)
3) Run `docker run -d -p 4000:80 challenge` (port 80 is exposed per the Dockerfile).
4) Go to `localhost:4000` if your OS matches the OS of the aforementioned terminal. If not, check the IP that the VM is
    running under, and replace 'localhost' with that when navigating to the website (typically 192.168.99.100)
